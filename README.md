This repository was created to provide updates to Professor Koffi.

koffi610.py: The current version includes a notebook that uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the one-dimensional heat equation.

koffi611.py: This version added x/y axis labels with physical meaning and units (position in m, time in s), implemented boundary residual diagnostics, visualized and analyzed individual loss components ($L_f$, $L_i$, $L_b$), and verified PINN consistency during training.

koffi612.py will come soon! That will be PINNS for waive equation...
