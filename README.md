This repository was created to provide updates to Professor Koffi.

koffi610.py: The current version includes a notebook that uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the one-dimensional heat equation.

koffi611.py: This version added x/y axis labels with physical meaning and units (position in m, time in s), implemented boundary residual diagnostics, visualized and analyzed individual loss components ($L_f$, $L_i$, $L_b$), and verified PINN consistency during training.

koffi612.py: PINNS for waive equation.

koffi612.py issue: why the last graph is so wierd? Because there should be \lambda1, \lambda2, \lambda3, respectively, in front of each of the three loss funtions.

The next step: the reaction difussion equation. Due by next Tuesday 3 PM, LA time.
